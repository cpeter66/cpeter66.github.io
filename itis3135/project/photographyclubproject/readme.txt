# Final Project Summary Document: UNCC Photography Club Website

## 1. Meeting the Specifications

This website meets or exceeds all technical and design requirements outlined in the course:

### ✅ JavaScript Dynamic Interactions:
- **Dynamic Header and Footer Loading**: Every page dynamically loads the header and footer via `loadHeader()` and `loadFooter()` functions using JavaScript to ensure consistency across the site.
- **Interactive Gallery Filtering**: The gallery page includes buttons ("All", "Portraits", "Landscapes") that use JavaScript to filter which image cards are displayed without reloading the page.
- **Modal Image Viewer**: Clicking on a gallery image opens it in a modal popup with a larger view and caption, enhancing interactivity and user experience.

### ✅ CRAP Design Principles:
- **Contrast**: Dark backgrounds and white text create strong contrast for readability. Buttons and links use color contrast to stand out.
- **Repetition**: Layout elements such as headers, buttons, and section styles are consistently repeated across all pages.
- **Alignment**: Text and components are left-justified or centered using flexbox and grid to maintain visual order.
- **Proximity**: Related elements such as image titles and descriptions are grouped, and spacing is used to guide the eye logically.

## 2. Critique Feedback and Revisions

Based on the peer feedback received, here are the changes and improvements I made:

- **Navigation Bar**: Updated the navigation bar to be sticky and consistent across all pages by loading it from a shared component file.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improved spacing and flexbox layout to make sure the site looks good on mobile devices.
- **Footer Consistency**: Added developer credits and HTML/CSS/WCAG validation links to the footer of each page via JavaScript.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensured all images have descriptive `alt` text, and buttons are clearly labeled for screen readers.

These changes addressed usability, consistency, and accessibility concerns raised during the critique phase.

## 3. Stakeholder Needs and Future Plans

This website is designed to serve the **UNCC Photography Club** by acting as a centralized platform for:
- **Showcasing member work** in a professional, organized gallery.
- **Advertising events** and meeting information.
- **Allowing prospective members** to learn more and get in touch.

By combining clean design with interactive functionality, this site meets the club’s need for an engaging, accessible, and easy-to-maintain online presence. In the future, I plan to expand the gallery with categorized albums, add a blog or news section for updates, and possibly integrate a member login system for managing submissions and events.
